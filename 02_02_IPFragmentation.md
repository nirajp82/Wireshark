1. **Need for Fragmentation**: The maximum packet size that can be transmitted is determined by the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit). Typically, an IP MTU is 1500 bytes on a local network, but this can vary across different parts of the network.

2. **Problem with Larger Packets**: If a packet is 1500 bytes but the next hop's MTU is smaller (e.g., 1200 bytes), the router cannot forward the packet as is. 

3. **Fragmentation Process**: If fragmentation is allowed (i.e., the "Do Not Fragment" bit is not set in the IP header), the router can split the large packet into smaller pieces—such as a 1200-byte and a 300-byte packet—and send them along their way. 

4. **Reassembly**: The smaller fragments travel independently but retain the same IP identifier (IPID), which allows the receiver to recognize that these fragments should be reassembled into the original packet.

5. **Flags and ICMP**: If the "Do Not Fragment" bit is set, the router will drop the packet and send an ICMP message back to the sender indicating the issue. If fragmentation is allowed, the router splits the packet and sends the fragments on their way.

In summary, IP fragmentation ensures that large packets can still be transmitted across networks with smaller MTUs by splitting them into smaller pieces, which are reassembled at the destination. The speaker notes that fragmentation is controlled by flags in the IP header, which can influence how packets are handled.
