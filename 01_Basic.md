## Default Columns in a Packet Capture Output

In Wireshark, the packet capture output contains a variety of columns to help you analyze network traffic. Below are the default columns displayed in a packet capture output.

| **Name**        | **Description**                                                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No.**         | Frame number from the beginning of the packet capture.                                  |
| **Time**        | Seconds from the first frame.                                                           |
| **Source (src)**| Source address, commonly an IPv4, IPv6, or Ethernet address.                           |
| **Destination (dst)**| Destination address.                                                                   |
| **Protocol**    | Protocol used in the Ethernet frame, IP packet, or TCP segment (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP).   |
| **Length**      | Length of the frame in bytes.                                                           |

These columns provide basic information about each captured packet. You can customize the columns displayed in Wireshark to suit your specific needs.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators in Wireshark display filters allow you to combine multiple conditions in a filter expression. Here are the most commonly used logical operators:

| **Operator**       | **Description**                          | **Example**                                                                                   | 
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **and** or **&&**   | **Logical AND**                          | All the conditions should match. Example: `ip.src == 192.168.1.1 and tcp.port == 80`         |
| **or** or *    | **Logical OR**                           | Either all or one of the conditions should match. Example: `ip.src == 192.168.1.1 or tcp.port == 443` |
| **xor** or **^^**   | **Logical XOR (Exclusive OR)**           | Exclusive alterations - only one of the two conditions should match, not both. Example: `ip.src == 192.168.1.1 xor ip.dst == 192.168.1.2` |
| **not** or **!**    | **Negation**                             | Inverts the condition. Example: `not ip.addr == 192.168.1.1` (show packets not from this IP) |
| **[n]** or **[...]**| **Substring operator**                   | Filters for specific words or text within the packet. Example: `http contains "GET"`              |

## Filtering Packets (Display Filters)

Display filters in Wireshark are used to selectively show packets based on various conditions. Below are common filter operators with examples:

| **Operator**       | **Description**                           | **Example**                                |**Description**                                                                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **eq** or **==**   | **Equal**                                 | `ip.dst == 192.168.1.1`                    | This filter will show packets where the destination IP address is exactly `192.168.1.1`.|
| **ne** or **!=**   | **Not equal**                             | `ip.dst != 192.168.1.1`                    | This filter will exclude packets where the destination IP address is 192.168.1.1.|
| **gt** or **>**    | **Greater than**                          | `frame.len > 10`                           | This filter will show packets where the frame length is greater than 10 bytes.  |
| **lt** or **<**    | **Less than**                             | `frame.len < 10`                           | This filter will show packets where the frame length is less than 10 bytes.|
| **ge** or **>=**   | **Greater than or equal**                 | `frame.len >= 10`                          | This filter will show packets with frame lengths greater than or equal to 10 bytes.|
| **le** or **<=**   | **Less than or equal**                    | `frame.len <= 10`                          | This filter will show packets with frame lengths less than or equal to 10 bytes.|


## Filter Types

Wireshark supports two types of filters:

| **Name**            | **Description**                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Capture filter**   | Filters packets during the capture process, reducing the amount of traffic stored in the capture file. |
| **Display filter**   | Filters packets after they have been captured, allowing you to hide unwanted packets from the display. |

## Wireshark Capturing Modes

Wireshark can be configured to capture packets in different modes, depending on the network interface.

| **Name**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Promiscuous mode**| Configures the network interface to capture all packets on the network segment to which it is connected. |
| **Monitor mode**    | Enables wireless interfaces (only on Unix/Linux systems) to capture all traffic that the interface can receive, including traffic not directed to the capturing device. |

## Miscellaneous

| **Name**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Slice Operator**       | `[...]` - A range of values, e.g., `frame[0:4]` extracts the first 4 bytes. |
| **Membership Operator**  | `{}` - "In" operator to check if a value belongs to a set (e.g., `ip.addr in {192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2}`). |
| **CTRL+E**               | Start or stop packet capture.                                                  |

## Capture and Display Filter Syntax

Understanding the syntax for capture and display filters is crucial for narrowing down packets of interest. Below are examples of filter syntax for both capture and display filters:

### Capture Filter Syntax

Capture filters are used to capture only the packets that meet specific conditions. They are applied before data is captured.

| **Syntax**                     | **Protocol**   | **Direction**   | **Hosts**             | **Value**         | **Logical Operator** | **Expressions**           |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Example**                    | `tcp`          | `src`           | `192.168.1.1`         | `80`              | `and`                | `tcp dst 202.164.30.1`    |

### Display Filter Syntax

Display filters are applied after data is captured, allowing you to refine your packet display.

| **Syntax**                     | **Protocol**   | **String 1**   | **String 2**  | **Comparison Operator** | **Value**         | **Logical Operator** | **Expressions**           |
|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Example**                    | `http`          | `dest`         | `ip`           | `==`                    | `192.168.1.1`     | `and`                | `tcp port`                |

### Summary of Key Points:

- **Ethernet** is the most common Layer 2 protocol for wired networks.
- **FDDI** was historically used for high-speed backbone networks but has mostly been replaced by Ethernet.
- **IP** is the core protocol of the internet and is used to route packets between devices.
- **ARP** is crucial for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local network.
- **RARP** was once used for diskless workstations to obtain an IP address but is largely obsolete today.
- **DECnet**, **LAT**, **MOP**, and their variants (**MOPRC**, **MOPDL**) were once proprietary protocols used in DEC systems, but they are now outdated and rarely used.
- **TCP** is used for reliable, ordered communications in most applications, while **UDP** is used for fast, low-latency applications where speed is prioritized over reliability.

### # Wireshark Packet Analysis - Filters and Answers

This document covers various Wireshark packet filters and the corresponding answers to questions related to packet analysis.

## 1. Find DNS Packets (Only DNS, No ICMP)
**Filter**: `dns and !icmp`

This filter will display only DNS packets while excluding any ICMP packets.

---

## 2. DNS Packets Including the Word "Foundation" Regardless of Case
**Filter**: `dns && frame matches "foundation"`

This filter captures DNS packets that contain the word "Foundation" (case insensitive).

---

## 3. DNS Requests for Domains That Do Not Have the Word "Foundation"
**Filter**: `dns && !dns matches "foundation"`

This filter will show DNS requests for domains that do not contain the word "foundation."

---

## 4. ICMP Packets
**Filter**: `icmp`

This simple filter shows all ICMP packets in the capture.

---

## 5. Packets on TCP Port 443
**Filter**: `tcp.port == 443`

This filter will show all packets that use TCP port 443, which is commonly used for HTTPS traffic.

---

## 6. How Many Packets Are in the Top IP Conversation?
**Steps**:
1. Go to **Statistics** menu.
2. Choose **Conversations**.
3. Select the **IPv4** tab.
4. Sort by **Packets**.

This will give you a summary of the top IP conversations sorted by the number of packets exchanged.

---

## 7. What is the Stream ID? Build a Filter for This Stream and Apply It.
To find the stream ID:
1. Go to **Statistics** menu.
2. Choose **Conversations**.
3. Select the **IPv4** tab.
4. Sort by **Packets**. -> Right click -> Apply as filter -> Selected -> Filter on Stream Id
   
---

## 8. In This Stream, How Many Packets Are Larger Than 100 Bytes?
**Filter**: `ip.stream eq 3 && frame.cap_len > 100`

This filter counts packets in stream 3 where the packet size is greater than 100 bytes. Adjust the stream number as necessary.

---

## 9. How Many Packets in the PCAP Have the TCP SYN Bit Set to 1?
**Filter**: `tcp.flags.syn == 1`

### Note:
- **SYN**: The client sends a packet with the SYN flag set to initiate a connection.
- **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a packet that has both SYN and ACK flags set.
- **ACK**: The client acknowledges the server’s response with a packet containing the ACK flag.

This filter identifies the packets where the SYN flag is set, indicating the initiation of a TCP connection.

---

## 10. How Many Packets Have the TCP Reset Bit Set to 1?
**Filter**: `tcp.flags.reset == 1`

### Note:
When the **RST (Reset)** flag is set, it indicates that the TCP connection is being forcibly reset. This can occur in several scenarios:
- **Connection refused**: If the server doesn’t want to establish a connection (e.g., because the port is closed).
- **Connection termination**: If one side of the connection encounters an error or is in an abnormal state and wants to abruptly terminate the session.
- **Protocol violations**: If there is an attempt to communicate on a connection that is already closed or not open.
- **Unexpected data**: A device receives data for a connection that has not been established.

---

## 11. How Many Packets Have the TCP SYN-ACK Flags Set to 1?
**Filter**: `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1`

This filter captures packets that have both the SYN and ACK flags set, indicating a response from the server during the TCP 3-way handshake (SYN-ACK).
